this command is used to copy your id into other servers that u r trying to manage so it can connect through ssh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/ed_25519.pub [dest ip address]

-since i didnt use a passphrase to the key, after entering this command, you ll find a file named authorized keys on the dest machine and find the key you added there,
the next time you connect to said machine you use this command :

ssh -i ~/.ssh/ed_25519.pub [dest ip add]

or just ssh destip
